## Week 1 Summary (09/29/2025)

### This week I worked on:

This week I researched Unity's documentation for implementing a phone's gyroscope and microphone. I experimented with porting one of my previous Unity projects to Android and testing it on my phone. I also learned to create and animate pixel art in Aseprite and made some rudimentary temporary assets.

### This week I learned:

I learned to use two pieces of software that will be very useful for the development of this project. Unity Remote is an Android app that will allow me to test my game on my phone and Aseprite is a Windows application used for making pixel art for games.

### My successes this week were:

I was able to get the Unity Remote app working to test a Unity project on my phone. Using the app I could make changes to the game on my computer that would update in real time on my phone.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

I am by no means an artist, so learning to use Aseprite has proven to be a challenge for me.

## Week 2 Summary (10/06/2025)
### This week I worked on:

This week I added a title screen and began developing the "spotlight" microgame. I added a spotlight that the player moves around the screen by tilting their phone as well as a dancer that moves randomly between points on a stage background. I also implemented an input system for the touchscreen and wrote a script that recognizes directional swipes.

### This week I learned:

This week I learned about Unity's Dot function, which multiplies the magnitudes of two vectors, then multiplies that total by the cosine of the two vectors, to return a value from -1 to 1. The closer the result is to 1, the closer the two vectors are to being parallel. I was able to use this function to compare the angle of a swipe on the touchscreen to vectors going up, down, left, and right to determine the direction of the swipe.

### My successes this week were:

I'm very pleased with the solution I found to move the spotlight across the screen according to the phone's rotation.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

This was my first time implementing motion controls in Unity. I first tried using the phone's accelerometer to detect motion, but I found out that it was unable to detect side-to-side tilting when the phone is held upright. I ended up using the phone's gyroscope, which was able to detect the phone's rotation rate in every direction, exactly what I needed.
