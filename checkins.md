## Week 1 Summary (09/29/2025)

### This week I worked on:

This week I researched Unity's documentation for implementing a phone's gyroscope and microphone. I experimented with porting one of my previous Unity projects to Android and testing it on my phone. I also learned to create and animate pixel art in Aseprite and made some rudimentary temporary assets.

### This week I learned:

I learned to use two pieces of software that will be very useful for the development of this project. Unity Remote is an Android app that will allow me to test my game on my phone and Aseprite is a Windows application used for making pixel art for games.

### My successes this week were:

I was able to get the Unity Remote app working to test a Unity project on my phone. Using the app I could make changes to the game on my computer that would update in real time on my phone.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

I am by no means an artist, so learning to use Aseprite has proven to be a challenge for me.

## Week 2 Summary (10/06/2025)
### This week I worked on:

This week I added a title screen and began developing the "spotlight" microgame. I added a spotlight that the player moves around the screen by tilting their phone as well as a dancer that moves randomly between points on a stage background. I also implemented an input system for the touchscreen and wrote a script that recognizes directional swipes.

### This week I learned:

This week I learned about Unity's Dot function, which multiplies the magnitudes of two vectors, then multiplies that total by the cosine of the two vectors, to return a value from -1 to 1. The closer the result is to 1, the closer the two vectors are to being parallel. I was able to use this function to compare the angle of a swipe on the touchscreen to vectors going up, down, left, and right to determine the direction of the swipe.

### My successes this week were:

I'm very pleased with the solution I found to move the spotlight across the screen according to the phone's rotation.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

This was my first time implementing motion controls in Unity. I first tried using the phone's accelerometer to detect motion, but I found out that it was unable to detect side-to-side tilting when the phone is held upright. I ended up using the phone's gyroscope, which was able to detect the phone's rotation rate in every direction, exactly what I needed.

## Week 3 Summary (10/13/25)
### This week I worked on:

This week I continued implementing the "spotlight" microgame by adding detection for when the dancer is inside or outside the spotlight. I also implemented the "curtain" microgame, adding a rope sprite that can be pulled up or down by swiping up or down on the touchscreen, as well as a curtain sprite that raises as the rope is pulled.

### This week I learned:

This week I learned that, using Unity's new input system, I can assign clicking the mouse on a computer to the same input action as tapping the touchscreen on a phone. This has helped me be able to quickly test elements of my game without having to build to my phone.

## Week 4 Summary (10/20/25)
### This week I worked on:

This week I wrote a script to access a connected microphone and detect the volume of the input, which will be used in the "belt a note" and "quiet on set" microgames.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

I hit a bit of a wall this week trying to gain access to the phone's microphone. Unity was unable to recognize any microphones connected, even when it recognized the phone itself. After much troubleshooting, I found out I needed to request permission from the phone user to access the microphone in the app. Due to this hurdle, as well as my sister having her baby, this week was not as productive.

## Week 5 Summary (10/27/25)
### This week I worked on:

This week I implemented the "belt a note" and "quiet on set" microgames utilizing the volume detection script I wrote last week to detect when the microphone's volume exceeds a certain threshold. The "quiet on set" microgame used similar scripts to detect when the screen is tapped as well as when the phone is tilted past a certain threshold using the gyroscope.

## Week 6 Summary (11/3/25)
### This week I worked on:

This week I began working on the "memorize your line" and "perform your line" microgames. I put the two microgames into one scene so that the player cannot encounter the "perform your line" microgame before they've been asked to memorize a line. Instead, the first time the player enters this scene, a random line is chosen and displayed for the player to memorize, and the next time they enter the same scene, three buttons appear different variations on the line and the player has to choose the correct one. Then a new line is picked for the player to memorize the next time they enter the scene.
