## Week 1 Summary (09/29/2025)

### This week I worked on:

This week I researched Unity's documentation for implementing a phone's gyroscope and microphone. I experimented with porting one of my previous unity projects to Android and testing it on my phone. I also learned to create and animate pixelart in Aseprite and made some rudimentary temporary assets.

### This week I learned:

I learned to use two pieces of software that will be very useful for the development of this project. Unity Remote is an Android app that will allow me to test my game on my phone and Aseprite is a Windows application used for making pixel art for games.

### My successes this week were:

I was able to get the Unity Remote app working to test a Unity project on my phone. Using the app I could make changes to the game on my computer that would update in real time on my phone.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

I am by no means an artist, so learning to use Aseprite has proven to be a challenge for me.
